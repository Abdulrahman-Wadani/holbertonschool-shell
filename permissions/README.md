# Shell, Permissions

## Description
This project is part of the system engineering and DevOps curriculum, focusing on **Linux File Permissions**, **User Management**, and **Group Control**. It covers how to secure files, manage access rights, and switch between different user identities safely.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the **Owner, Group, and Other** permission structure.
- Convert permissions between symbolic (`rwx`) and octal (`755`) formats.
- Use `chmod` to change file modes.
- Use `chown` and `chgrp` to manage file ownership.
- Learn the importance of `sudo` and the root user.
- Differentiate between `su` and `sudo` for privilege escalation.

## Core Commands
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `chmod` | Change file mode (permissions) |
| `chown` | Change file owner and group |
| `chgrp` | Change group ownership |
| `id` | Print real and effective user/group IDs |
| `whoami` | Print effective user ID |
| `sudo` | Execute a command with root privileges |
| `su` | Switch user or become superuser |
| `adduser` | Create a new user |

## Project Context
In Linux, everything is a file. Understanding who can read, write, or execute these files is the foundation of system security and administration.
